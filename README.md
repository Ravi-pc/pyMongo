# pyMongo
Project on fastAPI using Mongo db as database

1. Config
   from pymongo import MongoClient
   connection = MongoClient()

      Import Statement:
      from pymongo import MongoClient:
      This imports the MongoClient class from the pymongo package. MongoClient is the primary way to interact with a MongoDB instance from Python.

      Connection Establishment:
      connection = MongoClient():
      This line creates a connection to a MongoDB server. When no parameters are provided, MongoClient connects to the default MongoDB server running on localhost on port 27017. If the         server requires authentication or is running on a different host/port, additional parameters would need to be provided.

    After executing this code, the connection variable will hold an instance of MongoClient, which can be used to interact with the MongoDB server, such as creating, querying, updating,      and deleting databases and collections.
